# Notebooks
My collection of IPython notebooks to do all sorts of fun stuff. 

You can view these using the online Notebook viewer at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/. Enter the full repository url to the desired notebook and it'll render it for you. Note that the interactive parts of some note books will not be interactive. To interact with them, you will need to download the raw notebook and run it from your own local IPython (Jupyter) notebook server.

Suggestions and modifications welcome - submit them as pull requests.
